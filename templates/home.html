        <h1 class="display-3">Welcome to Paragraph A Day!</h1>
        <p class="lead"><span class="font-weight-bold">Paragraph A Day </span> is a tool made for writers, designed to make the writing practice enjoyable and motivating</p>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <p>Writing can be a rewarding experience, but getting started isn't always easy. Sometimes it's hard to find inspiration, to generate an idea we actually want to write about. Other times we have great ideas, but we have a hard time putting pen to paper, because the scope is intimidating and we're not sure where to begin. Other times we long to share ideas and inspiration with others, but we're hesitant because we don't want our writing to be driven by a desire for validation. Paragraph A Day reduces these pressures, by providing a unique image prompt every day, a 500 character limit, and the ability to share without judgment or feedback. Paragraph A Day is a place to have fun, explore ideas, and enjoy stress-free sharing with others.</p>

But something changed, and he has to tell her. But how do you tell someone your love has changed? As he tries again (he's lost count of how many times he's tried), he imagines how her face will look when she reads his words, the eager expectation, the slow crumbling, the reddening, the wetting with tears.  </p>

We have this amazing ability to memorialize our thoughts, to cement them and make them permanent, which is something truly unique to our species. I envision the writing of our ancestors reaching out from the past to touch me, and mine reaching out to touch those in the future. </p>

I see my paper and it repels me â€“ it's so empty, waiting for me to fill it. What will I come up with? Will it be good? Will it be terrible? The spaces within my mind fill with thoughts... will I choose to write them down or will I keep them, just for myself? </p>
